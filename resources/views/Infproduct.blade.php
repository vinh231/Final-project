                <span>PlayStation was the brainchild of <strong>Ken Kutaragi</strong>, a Sony executive who managed one of the company's hardware engineering divisions and was later dubbed "The Father of the PlayStation".</span>

                <h2>What is PlayStation?</h2>
                <p>Playstation is the name of a game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Playstation is merged from Play and Station – Meaning the company's original orientation as an entertainment multifunction device/station: Play Music, Play Video, and Play Game, not purely gaming like its competitors. I was Nintendo back then.

                   <br> That goal is still pursued by Sony to this day to keep the meaning of letting users know what the Playstation is – a multitasking entertainment machine. On the next-generation console Playstation 2 (PS2) you can watch DVD movies in addition to playing games. On PS3 you can surf the web and watch blueray. On PS4, Netflix along with a series of other entertainment features… Sony's goal doesn't stop at games & games, although that's its strength.
                    
                    <br>Just to explain what the Playstation is from the perspective of gamers - that's the name of the game console - is not quite enough. The word Play has a broad connotation of all that can be "played". The future PS5 generation will probably be Play the VR (Virtual Reality) according to many experts' speculations.
                    </p>
                <h2>PlayStation Network – What is PSN?</h2>
                <p>PlayStation Network is Sony's network server service. Launched in November 2006, PSN was originally a service exclusively for its PlayStation game consoles, later PSN expanded to other entertainment media such as smartphones, tablets, Bluray, and TV. Currently, PSN has more than 110 million registered users and 70 million regular users.</p>
                
                <h2>Benefits of owning a PlayStation:</h2>
                
                <li>Super good optimization:</li>
                <p>One thing is for sure, when I go to buy a PC to play games, with a configuration like this, what games will I be able to play? at what configuration level and how many FPS. However, for the PlayStation platform, you basically won't need to worry about that.

                    <br>With more than 10 million in hand, if you want to invest in a PC, you can only invest in a "enough" PC. For the same amount of money, a PS4 Pro will provide enough power for you to play every game in the PS4 game store with 60FPS on 4K resolution. From game production to release, Sony works extremely closely with game makers to ensure that when a game is brought to PlayStation, it is optimized as much as possible.
                    </p>
                <li>Low initial cost:</li>
                <p>A computer is a device that can help you with computing tasks that include playing games, not a device made to play games like PlayStation. Therefore, a computer to serve gaming needs will always require a significant investment cost compared to buying a PlayStation. Not to mention that once you've played PC games, you'll need to buy gaming gear as well. For example, with about 12 million VND, you can buy a PS4 Pro with powerful configuration and ready to play games.

                    <br>If when playing PC games, you will spend mainly on hardware and gaming gear, then with PlayStation, you have to invest that amount for buying copyrighted games. In general, once you have invested in a gaming device, it will cost you money, but it is certain that the cost of an initial PlayStation 4 will be much cheaper than a PC.
                    
                    </p>
                <li>Long-term value:</li>
                <p>While a PC with a mid-range configuration will easily become "dead" after about 3-4 years, it is normal for a generation of PlayStation to "live well" for up to 7-8 years. Investing in a PS4 is always a saving and long-term investment. One purchase can give you great gaming experiences and Sony support for the rest of its life.</p>
